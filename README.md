## Project Objective
This project aims to compare two popular approaches for predicting stock prices: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).

### Research Questions
1. Are these models sufficient for predicting stock prices using historical data?
2. Is LSTM superior to ARIMA for stock price prediction?

## Introduction
The stock market is a collection of markets where activities like buying, selling, and deploying shares occur. Predicting stock market behavior is challenging due to its non-linear, highly volatile nature, and the influence of various events.

## Methods
- **Data**: Stock prices of Grupo Bimbo from March 3, 2000, to April 3, 2024.
- **Models**: LSTM and ARIMA.
- **Evaluation**: Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Conclusion
The LSTM model outperformed the ARIMA model in predicting stock prices, with a significantly lower MSE.
